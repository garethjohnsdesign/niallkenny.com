A short profile film shot as part of the ASOS Urban Tour campaign. We meet London-based skateboard entrepreneur Lev Tanju. In this interview with the driving force behind Palace, Lev discusses his love for shooting skateboard videos on VHS, and the unique visual identity and sense of play that have made Palace important in a skate world bogged down by corporate bores.
